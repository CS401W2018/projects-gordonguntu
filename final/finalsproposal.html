        <h2> The title and topic of your site.</h2>
        <p> My title for the webpage is Indian Premier League. It is about a cricket league that India organises for all international and domestic cricket players every year.</p>
        <h2>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h2>
        <p> I chose this topic because I love playing cricket and I grew up watching IPL which is the short form for Indian Premier League. IPL is currently happening in India right now and I would like to show what it is and how is it played and some cool facts about cricket overall.</p>
        <h2>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h2>
        <p> Homepage - General information about Cricket and Introduction of IPL.
            <br> 1nd Page- IPL franchises and their owners <br> 2nd page - Highlights and famous players of the teams <br> 3rd Page My favorite team <br> 4th page- Current season - table position standings <br> 5th Page- I want to create a fan prediction form  
        </p>
        <h2>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h2>
        <p>In my form it is basically like a fan poll about teams and predictions about who will win this season and some questions about the teams and players, I would also ask them their name, email for more updates and a favorite team. In my table i would like to include the current ipl team standings their are 8 teams and i might do two tables one is the current and one is myown predicted standings table.</p>
        <h2>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h2>
        <p> I will use pictures from Players social media posts,wikipedia and information from different articles about the teams and their own webpages. two references i would like to list out are 1. Official IPL page <a href="https://www.iplt20.com/">IPL</a>  2. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League">Wikipedia</a></p>
        <h2>I read and understand all the warnings given about the final project.</h2>
