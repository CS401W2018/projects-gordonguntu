<h1>My Interest - Playing Cricket</h1>
</header>


<main>

<p id="firstpar">Cricket is sport played internationally, it is an outdoor team game which involves a ball and a bat and two teams, usually there are 11 players in team. the objective is to hit the ball with the bat and score runs, there is a boundary line and if the ball when hit goes out of the boundary line along the ground it is considered as 4 runs or points and when it goes over the boundary line it is considered 6 points. The objective is to score more runs and not get out.</p>



<p id="secondpar"> I love cricket because it can get very competitive, it is unpredictable and exciting to play because of high and low dynamics and it showcases team spirit and camaraderie among the players. <span class="india">I love the Indian Cricket team</span>, they have a strong side and really give a tough competition, I grew up watching India play cricket and since then I played as a kid, in high school and also won some matches in high school. I love to bat and ball as well, so I consider myself an all-rounder and a good player. I love Virat Kohli, he is one of the greatest player in Cricket History and has a good record.</p>
